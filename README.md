## Testing Callbacks

Order callbacks in the SpectroCoin plugin allow your WordPress site to automatically process order status changes sent from SpectroCoin. These callbacks notify your server when an orderâ€™s status transitions to PAID, EXPIRED, or FAILED. Understanding and testing this functionality ensures your store handles payments accurately and updates order statuses accordingly.
 
1. Go to your SpectroCoin project settings and enable **Test Mode**.
2. From the __Test mode__ select a payment status (__PAID__ or __EXPIRED__), which will be sent with a callback.
3. Ensure your `callbackUrl` is publicly accessible (local servers like `localhost` will not work).
4. Check the **Order History** in SpectroCoin for callback details. If a callback fails, use the **Retry** button to resend it.
5. Verify that:
   - The **order status** in WordPress has been updated accordingly.
   - The **callback status** in the SpectroCoin dashboard is `200 OK`.
